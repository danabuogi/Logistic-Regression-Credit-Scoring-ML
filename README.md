# Logistic-Regression-Credit-Scoring-ML Model Deployed using Django

A credit scoring model for a bank, enabling them to make data-driven lending decisions. Credit scoring is a statistical analysis performed by banks and financial institutions to determine the credit score of a borrower. Borrowerâ€™s repayment history, length of credit history, number of credit inquiries made in the past, and number of active credit cards and loans, all contribute to the computation of credit score. The score acts as a proxy for banks to gauge the creditworthiness of a loan applicant.
